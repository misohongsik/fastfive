    "date": "2025-12-05",
    "prepared_by": "Software Development Manager"
  },
  "product_overview": "This document outlines the debugging plan and requirements to resolve the text overlap issue in the 'Problem Section' of the TestSprite frontend, specifically focusing on the second section named 'The Reality'. The plan addresses layout collisions, style verifications, responsive design challenges, and potential animation disruptions caused by GSAP.",
  "core_goals": [
    "Identify the root causes of text overlapping issues in the Problem Section, particularly in the second subsection titled 'The Reality'.",
    "Ensure text elements including section titles, labels, card numbers, and card titles do not collide visually across all device resolutions.",
    "Verify and improve CSS styles related to line-height, margin, padding, and height constraints to accommodate content without overlap.",
    "Test responsive behavior on critical viewport sizes (mobile small, medium, tablet) to confirm compatibility and readability.",
    "Evaluate impact of GSAP animations on layout and ensure animations do not cause visual artifacts or overlapping text.",
    "Recommend and implement CSS fixes to resolve overlap issues and maintain a consistent and clean user interface across all devices."
  ],
  "key_features": [
    "Detection of element collisions using layout inspection scripts to measure bounding rectangles and identify intersections between key text elements.",
    "Detailed CSS and style verification including line-height values, margin bottom application, and flexbox behaviors that may affect layout integrity.",
    "Responsive viewport testing methodology covering various device widths and heights focusing on height constraints and visual space allocation.",
    "Temporary disabling of GSAP animations to isolate whether animation transforms contribute to text overlap.",
    "Specific, actionable recommendations to adjust min-height, padding, positioning, and line-height CSS properties to fix identified overlap issues.",
    "Focused debugging on Problem Section component using relevant React/TypeScript files to ensure targeted improvements."
  ],
  "user_flow_summary": [
    "User visits the landing page and scrolls down to the Problem Section labeled 'The Reality'.",
    "User views the section title, label text, and descriptive cards with numbers and titles without text collisions or overlaps.",
    "Responsive adjustment triggers on different viewport sizes to ensure legible layout and no overlap.",
    "Animations run smoothly without causing layout distortions or overlapping text.",
    "After fixes, user experiences clear, readable text blocks in the Problem Section across devices without visual clutter or content clipping.",
    "Validation testing confirms all breakpoints and animation toggles maintain text clarity and proper spacing."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "No intersection of bounding client rectangles between section title, labels, card numbers, and card titles as measured by layout inspection script.",
    "Explicit line-height values are set and tested across all affected text elements to prevent line collapse.",
    "Cards in Problem Section use flexible heights (min-height or auto height) instead of fixed vh heights where necessary to prevent content clipping.",
    "Padding and positioning adjustments maintain consistent spacing between text elements across all tested viewport sizes.",
    "Disabling GSAP temporarily removes any overlapping issues, identifying if animation transforms cause visual artifacts.",
    "Functional testing on mobile small (320x568), mobile medium (375x667), and tablet (768px wide) viewports show no text overlap.",
    "Code changes are isolated to ProblemSection.tsx and relevant style sheets to ensure targeted debugging scope."
