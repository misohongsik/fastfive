TestSprite Debugging Plan for Fastfive Text Overlap
1. Target Component & Issue
Component: 
app/components/ProblemSection.tsx
Reported Issue: Text overlapping in the second section ("The Reality" section).
Potential Areas:
"The Reality" Label vs Main Heading ("사무실 구하기...")
Main Heading vs Content Cards (due to absolute positioning)
Card Number ("01") vs Card Title ("보증금의 압박")
2. Debugging Steps (TestSprite Instructions)
A. Element Collision Detection
 Run Layout Inspection Script:
Select elements: h2 (Section Title), .text-red-500 (Label), .text-6xl (Card Number), h3 (Card Title).
Calculate getBoundingClientRect() for each.
Check for intersection areas > 0 pixels between adjacent text blocks.
B. CSS & Style Verification
 Computed Styles:
Verify line-height values. Are they unitless (e.g., 1, 1.2) or fixed (px)?
Check mb-* (margin-bottom) application.
Hypothesis: flex flex-col justify-between on the card might be forcing elements together if the card height (40vh) is too small for the content on specific mobile aspect ratios.
C. Responsive Viewport Tests
 Test Resolutions:
Mobile Small: 320px width / 568px height (iPhone SE) - Critical (Height constraints often cause overlap in vh based layouts).
Mobile Medium: 375px / 667px.
Tablet: 768px.
 Check constraints:
Is h-[40vh] sufficient to hold the text content without collapsing margins?
D. Animation Interference
 GSAP Check:
Disable GSAP temporarily. Does the HTML/CSS layout overlap without animation?
If no, the issue is native CSS.
If yes, skewX or xPercent transformations might be creating visual artifacts.
3. Recommended Fixes based on Findings
If Card Content Overlaps: Change h-[40vh] to min-h-[40vh] or h-auto to allow expansion.
If Section Title Overlaps Cards: Increase top position of Cards or adjust pl/pr padding values.
If Line-Height Issue: Force explicit pixel values for line-height instead of relative tailwind classes.
